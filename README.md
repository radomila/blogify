# Blogify

Blogify is a full-stack web application, that has been created as a part of the Master's thesis, which is focusing on web accessibility. 
Blogify enables authorized users to manage blog posts. This involves creation, read, update or deletion of blog posts.
Users can be authorized using a sign up form, requiring e-mail address and password, which has to be confirmed.
Otherwise, they can only browse and read posts without being able to create and manage their own.
